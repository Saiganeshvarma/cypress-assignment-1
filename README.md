# Cypress Demo Test

This repository is built using [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/). The tests cover various user interactions and workflows, ensuring the application's functionality and reliability.

## Prerequisites

Before running the tests, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v12 or later)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)
- **Cypress** (install via npm or yarn)
- **Git** (to clone the repository)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Pooja-Gangavathi/cypress_demo_test.git
   cd cypress_demo_test
   ```

2. **Install cypress:**

Install Cypress as a development dependency.
```bash
npm install cypress --save-dev
```

3. **Open Cypress Test Runner:**

   Use the following command to open Cypress's graphical interface to view and run tests interactively:

   ```bash
   npx cypress open
   ```

4. **Run Tests in Headless Mode:**

   To run tests in the terminal without opening the Cypress GUI, use:

   ```bash
   npx cypress run
   ```

## Viewing Test Reports

Cypress generates reports for test results. To view them:

**Run tests to view the report** 

   ```bash
   npx cypress run
   ```
   which will create test report of pass and fail test.

This README should guide you through setting up, running, and reporting on your tests in the `cypress_demo_test` repository.
